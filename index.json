Economists have been rapidly learning to use Python in research and teaching, and it is no stranger to young PhD students and researchers.\nThe ecosystem of Python developer and user community is huge, it is safe to say that Python is the computer language for everything.\nPython is awarded the programming language of the year 2020.\nPython trends\nJupyter notebook The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebook documents that include:\nLive code Interactive widgets Plots Narrative text Equations Images Video These documents provide a complete and self-contained record of a computation that can be converted to various formats and shared with others using email, Dropbox, version control systems (like git/GitHub) or nbviewer.jupyter.org.\nThe Jupyter Notebook combines three components:\nThe notebook web application: An interactive web application for writing and running code interactively and authoring notebook documents. Kernels: Separate processes started by the notebook web application that runs users’ code in a given language and returns output back to the notebook web application. Notebook documents: Self-contained documents that contain a representation of all content visible in the notebook web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, narrative text, equations, images, and rich media representations of objects. Each notebook document has its own kernel. Notebooks consist of a sequence of cells. There are three basic cell types:\nCode cells: Input and output of live code that is run in the kernel Markdown cells: Narrative text with embedded LaTeX equations Raw cells: Unformatted text that is included, without modification, when notebooks are converted to different formats using nbconvert Internally, notebook documents are JSON data with binary values base64 encoded. This allows them to be read and manipulated programmatically by any programming language. Because JSON is a text format, notebook documents are version control friendly.\nNotebooks can be exported to different static formats including HTML, reStructeredText, LaTeX, PDF, and slide shows (reveal.js) using Jupyter’s nbconvert utility.\nFurthermore, any notebook document available from a public URL or on GitHub can be shared via nbviewer. This service loads the notebook document from the URL and renders it as a static web page. The resulting web page may thus be shared with others without their needing to install the Jupyter Notebook.\nThrough Jupyter’s kernel and messaging architecture, the Notebook allows code to be run in a range of different programming languages. For each notebook document that a user opens, the web application starts a kernel that runs the code for that notebook. Each kernel is capable of running code in a single programming language and there are kernels available in the following languages:\nPython(https://github.com/ipython/ipython) Julia (https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) R (https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel) Ruby (https://github.com/minrk/iruby) Haskell (https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) Scala (https://github.com/Bridgewater/scala-notebook) node.js (https://gist.github.com/Carreau/4279371) Go (https://github.com/takluyver/igo) The default kernel runs Python code. The notebook provides a simple way for users to pick which of these kernels is used for a given notebook.\nEach of these kernels communicate with the notebook web application and web browser using a JSON over ZeroMQ/WebSockets message protocol that is described here. Most users don’t need to know about these details, but it helps to understand that “kernels run code.”\nPython starter Python is generic. It is a calcultor to start with, and it is a gigantic system used to run big systems by corporates.\nData types boolean int, double, complex strings None Operators mathematical logical bitwise membership identity assignment and in-place operators operator precedence Collections Sequence containers - list, tuple Mapping containers - set, dict The collections module Functions and methods Anatomy of a function Docstrings Class methods Control flow if and the ternary operator Checking conditions - what evaluates as true/false? if-elif-else while break, continue pass Loops and comprehensions for, range, enumerate lazy and eager evaluation list, set, dict comprehensions generator expression Packages and namespace Modules (file) Package (hierarchical modules) Namespace and naming conflicts Using import Batteries included 3+4 7 Arithmetic Operators The …","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"8e9e1ed2a79db444fcbf6f1a764c4c53","permalink":"https://shutaocao.github.io/course/econ4060/lect00_pythonintro/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/econ4060/lect00_pythonintro/","section":"course","summary":"Python Brief Introduction\n","tags":null,"title":"Brief Introduction to Python","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Videos\nfrom datetime import datetime, date, timedelta from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo # from IPython.display import (display_pretty, display_html, display_jpeg, display_png, display_json, display_latex, display_svg) print(\u0026#39;Milton Friedman on inflation\u0026#39;) startTime=int(timedelta(hours=0, minutes=18, seconds=0).total_seconds()) stopTime=int(timedelta(hours=0, minutes=23, seconds=0).total_seconds()) vid = YouTubeVideo(\u0026#34;THAaIZmxfNA\u0026#34;, width=720, height=480, start=startTime, end=stopTime) display(vid) Milton Friedman on inflation ","date":1705276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705276800,"objectID":"ce55b223c6637ade2fe25e7dbd1a4c81","permalink":"https://shutaocao.github.io/course/econ1020/econ1020readings_ch08/","publishdate":"2024-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/econ1020/econ1020readings_ch08/","section":"course","summary":"Videos\n","tags":null,"title":"Chapter 8 Optional Readings","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Python Basics.\nFirst lecture\nLearn Crash course in Python [lect00_pythonIntro.html](Brief Introduction to Python)\nQuiz What is the difference between lists and tuples?

I then customized my GitHub page before deploying the website to GitHub. Everything is done in terminal in Fedora Linux.\nClone the template On local computer Intall GO and Hugo-extended In terminal:\nsudo dnf install golang Note, I did not install Go by snap as suggested here.\nNext, I downloaded the hugo-extended from https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases. After decompressing the .gz file, I moved the binary hugo to /usr/bin/hugo, which replaces hugo installed by dnf install hugo.\nCreate local folder for all source files In terminal:\ngit clone https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic.git myAcademicSite cd myAcademic git submodule update --init --recursive This clones the starter-academic theme template to local folder myAcademic. Remove the folder public/ if there is one:\nrm -r public/ In terminal, if not already in the folder myAcadmicSite, do:\ncd myAcademicSite Then\nhugo server --disableFastRender Copy the http address http://localhost:1313/ and paste it in browser address bar. This will start the starter-academic original website on my local computer.\nHit keyboard Ctrl+c to stop hugo server.\nConfigure and Edit Website Next, I configure and edit my website by modifying configuration files and folders. It is important to know the file structure of Hugo templates:\ncontent/ holds the content of all web pages and web page sections. assets/media/ holds media file, e.g. image and videos. config/_default/ holds site configuration files. config.yamlconfigures Hugo, such as site title, url, Hugo options, enable page features. params.yaml configures Wowchemy options, e.g., SEO, site features. menus.yaml layouts menu links, used if the menu is enabled in params.yaml. First, in folder myAcdemicSite, in the file config/_default/config.yaml, set the baseurl to my website address:\nbaseurl = \u0026#34;https://shutaocao.github.io/\u0026#34;\nEdit my site Edit the following files\ncontent/_index.md. config/_default/config.yaml. config/_default/menus.yaml. config/_default/params.yaml. Content Blocks File content/_index.md list all web page sections in one place, each section is a content block. I use the existing blocks which include collection, portfolio, about, markdown. Web page sections are displayed in the order the content blocks are stacked in content/_index.md.\nIntroducing myself can be done in content/authors/admin/_index.md.\nNavigation Menu The navigation bar on the top of my website is customized in config/_default/menus.yaml. It is straightforward to customize it. There are two things worth of mentioning.\nThe url option.\nurl: \u0026#39;#publications\u0026#39; refers to the id publications of block Publications listed in content/_index.md. url: \u0026#39;publication/\u0026#39; refers to the folder content/publication/. A drop-down menu in navigation bar can be built by following template Online Courses at https://wowchemy.com/templates/.\nDeploy the Website to GitHub I already have my personal GitHub page, on the main branch. I removed all files for my old GitHub page, from terminal by using git rm.\nPush website to GitHub In terminal:\ncd myAcademicSite git submodule add -f -b main https://github.com/shutaocao/shutaocao.github.io.git public It creates folder myAcademic/public/ that will have all contents to be pushed to GitHub. If the shutao.github.io is on the gh-pages branch, then replace main with gh-pages in the last line of command above.\nNext, in terminal:\ncd myAcademicSite hugo This generates content of the website to be published on GitHub and copy them to public/. In case public/ did not exist, hugo would create it.\nFinally, depoly contents in public/ to GitHub\ncd public git remote set-url origin git@github.com:shutaocao/shutaocao.github.io.git git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Build website\u0026#34; git push cd .. This now has deployed my website to GitHub.\nThe push above uses SSH key to access GitHub and push files.\nAlternatively, GitHub Actions is new and can be used, but I did not use it.\nUpdate contents In terminal:\nhugo --gc cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;first deploy\u0026#34; git push origin main cd .. Two things to note:\nExecuting hugo builds the website from source files. git push needs SSH key that should have already been setup to access to GitHub from terminal. Update the template To update the starter-academic template to the latest version, use the file go.mod.\nIn terminal:\ncd myAcdemicSite hugo mod get -u This will update go.mod to the latest releases of wowchemy theme and modules. Re-run `hugo’ to update the website template.\nTo update or migrate to the latest configuration YAML releases, can use Hugo Scripts.\nMore details are documented at https://wowchemy.com/docs/hugo-tutorials/update/\nMain references: https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/get-started/\nhttps://wowchemy.com/docs/hugo-tutorials/deployment/\nhttps://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ …","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672358400,"objectID":"6c10f9293756fb56360ea8dd46803593","permalink":"https://shutaocao.github.io/post/hosting-webpage-on-github/","publishdate":"2021-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hosting-webpage-on-github/","section":"post","summary":"How to create GitHub page using the Academic theme.","tags":["GitHub page","Academic"],"title":"Hosting Webpage on GitHub","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shutao Cao","Césaire A.

We find that as the model economy adjusts to commodity price shocks, domestic downstream linkages and the export connection with the rest of the world play an important role.","tags":null,"title":"Production Networks and the Propagation of Commodity Price Shocks","type":"preprint"},{"authors":["Shutao Cao","Danny Leung"],"categories":null,"content":"The 2020 Best Paper Award, category Financial Economics, Economic Modelling.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"544dc2c64214ab16c46beed4a33727c8","permalink":"https://shutaocao.github.io/publication/2020sme-financialfrictions/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020sme-financialfrictions/","section":"publication","summary":"To what extent firms are constrained by external credit is usually unobserved in commonly used firm-level data. We use a survey of financing among Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises to measure the likelihood of a firm being constrained by credit. We find that firm size, current debt-to-asset ratio and cash flow are robust indicators of being financially constrained, while long-term debt to asset ratio is not a significant indicator of credit constraints. We then estimate the firm-level total factor productivity, taking into account the measured credit constraints. Omitting credit constraints leads to an upward bias of productivity estimates, by 4 percent. In addition, we find no strong evidence that suggests credit constraints lead to slower productivity growth. Finally, we confirm that both investment and employment growth are negatively affected by the measured credit constraints.","tags":null,"title":"Credit constraints and productivity of SMEs: Evidence from Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

We use a multisector growth model for a small open economy to quantify the contribution of sector-specific technology and relative prices of trade to productivity slowdown. We show that the effective aggregate total factor productivity consists of two components: the weighted average of sector-specific technology, and the weighted averaged of domestic-export price ratios which reflect export costs. This extends the Domar aggregation result of Hulten (1978). When calibrated to the Canadian data, the model suggests that productivity slowdown was mainly attributed to two sectors: commodity; machinery and equipment. Cross-country data show that, in two thirds of countries that experienced productivity slowdown, slower productivity growth in sectors serving domestic market was a dominant factor, while in the other one third, reduced domestic-export price ratio played a major role.\n","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506816000,"objectID":"8e9377ae6b9b694b7f9bf3ed87418488","permalink":"https://shutaocao.github.io/preprint/2017productivity-domaraggregation/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/preprint/2017productivity-domaraggregation/","section":"preprint","summary":"Fluctuations of commodity prices are frequently associated with the volatility of aggregate output and prices.

First, we provide results that link two closely related literatures on firm characteristics and exchange rate pass-through, and currency of invoicing and pass-through. We show that there is significant within- and across-industry heterogeneity in the currency of invoice of exports of Canadian goods to the U.S. and, further, in the degree of pass-through to producer prices. Next, we exploit the fact that we observe firms that sell the same good to both the domestic and export markets, often in different currencies, to difference out the common marginal cost component of the prices. This allows us to relate markups to exchange rate movements and we find evidence that pricing-to-market is most prominent when firms are setting export prices in U.S. dollars.","tags":null,"title":"Pricing-to-market, currency invoicing and exchange rate pass-through to producer prices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shutao Cao"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract This paper studies the effects of capital reallocation on aggregate productivity.

Firms with lower productivity are more likely to be reallocated to more-productive firms, and they also experience increases in productivity after reallocation. I use a dynamic model of firm investment and capital reallocation to match these facts. In the model, increased participation in the acquisition market by heterogeneous firms results in an increase in aggregate labor productivity, while the productivity of capital declines due to decreasing returns to scale.
